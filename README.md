bash-scripts
=======
Author: Kristjan Kaitsa

Bash shell scripts, that I have created for my own personal usage. However, you may or may not find something useful here either for "out of box usage" or as reference material. Feel free to take a look.
They may not be particularly optimised or elegant in style: just something to get a work done.

### Descriptions

Before submitting to Github, I have added a special header to all scripts, containing various information including description.
However, I'll also copy those short comments here to have general overview of the repository:

* **bitcoin-status.sh** - This scripts continuously displays bitcoin price from Bitstamp.net market (value of one BTC in USD) and the latest block height and age from BlockChain.info.

### Usage

The '*usage*' section in script's comments describes how to launch it (e.g. parameters).
There may be relevant information regarding the use of script additionally in the '*notes*' section, too.

### Dependencies

In case script requires additional tools besides **GNU Core Utilities**, it's mentioned in the '*notes*' section of comments.

### General Environment

Most scripts were developed in either Ubuntu or Debian.
Scripts include, as comment, bash version they were developed and tested in.
In case of something special it's described in the 'notes' section in comments.

### Licence and Contributions

My scripts are released into the **public domain**, which basically means that you're free to do whatever you want with them. Both for personal or commercial use. If you modify or include them in some of your application, then I certainly *appreciate* if you include me in your credits, but that isn't absolutely necessary.
However, I can't be hold liable for any damage that you may cause by use or misues of my scripts either.

Feel free to submit fixes, modifications, upgrades, whatever.
